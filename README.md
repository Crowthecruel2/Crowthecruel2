- Hi, I’m @Crowthecruel2 also known as Fanie van Vuuren
- I’m interested in Gane development and am working on my own game called "The Darkest Timeline". A auto battle strategy game with complex unit mechanics.
- I've made my own DnD inspired TTRPG game called origin story. You can find it at https://crowthecruel2.github.io/Origin-Story/index.html. It's about superheroes and supervillains fighting to take control of the "The Big City". There is also a tabletop war game inspired by games like warhammer.
- I have a degree in BSC IT.
- How to reach me? Feel free to contact me at my email fanie3vvuuren@gmail.com
